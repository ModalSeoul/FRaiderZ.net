 * Yo, McSic. Not sure if you're familiar with SCSS, but here's a quick run-down.
 * First off, don't freak out. If you don't want to take advantage of SCSS features,
 * you can simply write normal CSS within these files and it will work just fine.
 * First off, the main thing with SCSS for most people, is accessing children
Example:

                          .content-wrapper {

                            .__header {
                              display: flex;
                              justify-content: center;
                            }
                          }

* This would access the class "content-wrapper", then access content-wrapper's
child, "__header(BEM standard naming)" and set __header's display to flex, as
well as go ahead and justify-content pos.

* Also, quickly, you can do shit like this too

                        .header-item {
                          background-color: #282828;
                          color: #ccc;
                          border: 1px solid #323232;
                          transition: 1s;

                          &:hover {
                            background-color: #323232;
                            border: 1px solid #373737;
                          }
                        }
